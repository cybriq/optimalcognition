A scratchpad for some notes about how to discover one's ideal type of work

## Case Study 1: Loki Verloren (the author!)

1. Lego

In my play with my first toy, and my passion for the toy:

I first showed that I enjoy playing with permutations, taking a set of pieces and finding new ways to arrange them.

I never made big constructions, even when my collection got quite large. I tended towards small things, and playing with how to structure them most efficiently.

I wasn't really interested in representational things either, I enjoyed the geometry and visual elements, textures, repeating patterns, and so forth.

I did not fall in love with anything I made, it would usually be torn apart before I would even bother to show it to anyone, and showing it to people was not a major motivation.

2. Computer Programming

My initial work with programming was on a TRS-80 Color Computer. 

Firstly, I got in lots of trouble modifying the code my father had spent many hours inputting from programming magazines. I was more interested in seeing how the system went from the details and to the result.

When I actually got to doing something by myself, it was after I first saw a Macintosh computer. My very first piece of code combined multi dimensional arrays and boolean logic, making a sprite.

I first figured out how to paint the pointer.

Then I somewhere read about bitmasking, and created the transparent boundary around it that makes it stand out on a black ground.

Then I started learning how to use the bitmask with the bitmap to create a difference that allowed my code to avoid ever painting any pixel twice.
